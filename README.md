The application is a collection of cocktails and their preparation instructions. It consists of six pages:

Login:
This page displays two input fields for the username and password, a login button, and a link to the registration page. If the user makes a mistake while entering the details, an error message is displayed. After successful login, the user is redirected to the cocktails page.

Registration:
This page has three input fields for the username, password, and repeat password. If the user enters different passwords, the "registration" button becomes inactive, and an error message is displayed. Similarly, if the username is not entered or already exists, an error message is displayed.

Cocktails:
This page displays a text input field for searching cocktails by name. It also shows a list of cocktails whose names begin with the letter "T". Each card has a "Details" button that leads to the page with detailed information about the cocktail.

Cocktail Details:
This page displays comprehensive information about the selected cocktail and has an "Add to Favorites" button.

Filters:
This page has four sections that represent different types of filters: "Category", "Glass Type", "Ingredients", and "Drink Type". Each section displays all possible filter values, and each value works as a link. Filters under the "Ingredients" category are visualized with a photo and text. Clicking on any of the filters redirects the user to a page that lists all cocktails matching the selected filter.
